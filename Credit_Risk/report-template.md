## Overview of the Analysis

This Credit Risk Analysis Report aims to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in predicting credit risk for loans. The primary purpose of this analysis is to assess the model's ability to distinguish between healthy and high-risk loans accurately. The report will provide insights into the model's precision, recall, and accuracy scores to determine its suitability for deployment in the company's lending processes.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1 (Imbalanced Data):
    * Accuracy Score: The original model achieved a strong accuracy score of 0.952.
    * Precision Scores:
        Class 0 (Healthy Loans): Precision of 1.00.
        Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): Precision of 0.85.
    * Recall Scores:
        Class 0 (Healthy Loans): Recall of 0.99.
        Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): Recall of 0.91.

* Machine Learning Model 2 (Resampled Data):
    * Accuracy Score: The oversampled model achieved an exceptional accuracy score of 0.994.
    * Precision Scores:
        Class 0 (Healthy Loans): Precision of 0.99.
        Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): Precision of 0.99.
    * Recall Scores:
        Class 0 (Healthy Loans): Recall of 0.99.
        Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): Recall of 0.99.
  

## Summary

The high precision and recall scores (0.99) for both classes suggest that the model is reliable in identifying credit risk accurately. The balanced accuracy score indicates that the model maintains a strong equilibrium in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans.

Given these results, the model is highly recommended for use by the company. Its exceptional performance can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the credit risk assessment process, minimizing potential losses associated with high-risk loans and optimizing lending decisions. Deploying this model can contribute to improved credit risk management and decision-making within the organization.

In conclusion, the machine learning model, with its outstanding predictive performance, is a valuable asset for the company's credit risk analysis. It offers a robust solution to distinguish between healthy and high-risk loans, ultimately safeguarding the company's financial stability and lending practices.
